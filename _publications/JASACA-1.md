### Abstract

While the HVTN 505 trial showed no overall efficacy of the tested vaccine to
prevent HIV infection over placebo, previous studies, biological theories, and the finding
that immune response markers strongly correlated with infection in vaccine recipients generated the hypothesis that a qualitative interaction occurred. This hypothesis can be assessed
with statistical methods for studying treatment effect modification by an intermediate response variable (i.e., principal stratification effect modification (PSEM) methods). However,
available PSEM methods make untestable structural risk assumptions, such that assumptionlean versions of PSEM methods are needed in order to surpass the high bar of evidence to
demonstrate a qualitative interaction. Fortunately, the survivor average causal effect (SACE)
literature is replete with assumption-lean methods that can be readily adapted to the PSEM
application for the special case of a binary intermediate response variable. We map this adaptation, opening up a host of new PSEM methods for a binary intermediate variable measured
via two-phase sampling, for a dichotomous or failure time final outcome and including or
excluding the SACE monotonicity assumption. The new methods support that the vaccine
partially protected vaccine recipients with a high polyfunctional CD8+ T cell response, an
important new insight for the HIV vaccine field.
