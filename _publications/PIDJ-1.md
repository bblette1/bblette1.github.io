### Abstract

Background: 
Sapovirus is increasingly recognized as an important cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children. We identified risk factors and characterized the clinical profile of sapovirus AGE in a birth cohort in León, Nicaragua.

Methods: 
We conducted a case-control study nested within a birth cohort (n = 444). Fieldworkers conducted weekly household AGE surveillance. AGE stools were tested for sapovirus by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. For each first sapovirus episode, we selected 2 healthy age-matched controls and estimated independent risk factors of sapovirus AGE using conditional logistic regression. We compared clinical characteristics of sapovirus AGE episodes with episodes associated with other etiologies and identified co-infections with other enteric pathogens.

Results: 
From June 2017 to July 2019, we identified 63 first sapovirus AGE episodes and selected 126 controls. Having contact with an individual with AGE symptoms and vaginal delivery were independent risk factors for sapovirus AGE. All cases experienced diarrhea, lasting a median 6 days; 23% experienced vomiting. Compared with children with AGE due to another etiology, sapovirus AGE was similar in severity, with less reported fever. Most cases experienced co-infections and were more likely than controls to be infected with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli or astrovirus.

Conclusions: 
Sapovirus was a commonly identified AGE etiology in this Central American setting, and symptoms were similar to AGE associated with other etiologies. The association between vaginal delivery and sapovirus is a novel finding. Gut microbiome composition might mediate this relationship, or vaginal delivery might be a proxy for other risk factors. Further investigation into more specific biological mechanisms is warranted.
