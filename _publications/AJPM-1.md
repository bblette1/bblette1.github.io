### Abstract

Introduction: Physical activity (PA) and nutrition policies in schools can have substantial impacts on student health outcomes. While public health officials and legislators have introduced measures to improve such policies, the extent to which policies have changed is not well understood. This study identifies latent classes of PA and nutrition policy environments and explores changes in the prevalence of these classes from 2000-2016.

Methods: We analyzed data from the School Health Policies and Practices Study, a repeated cross-sectional CDC survey administered at the school district level in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2016. We identified subgroups of policy environments using latent class analysis and compared subgroup distributions across time and urban/rural classification. We further evaluated association of policies with year and urbanicity using logistic regression after dichotomizing class based on satisfaction in meeting recommendations.

Results: We identified five latent classes each for PA and nutrition policy environments, all with distinct characteristics. PA policies improved between consecutive survey years from 2000-2006 (p<0.001) and then plateaued until 2016, whereas nutrition policies improved consistently from 2000-2016 (p<0.001, p=0.011, p<0.001). While we found significant disparities between urban and rural school districts, these disparities narrowed during the years studied, particularly for PA policies.

Conclusions: Our findings support that PA and nutrition policies at the school district level improved from 2000-2016, possibly as a result of legislative and policy advocacy efforts. However, many areas for improvement remain. Unsatisfactory latent classes that remained prevalent though 2016 may highlight policy domains that should be targeted by future legislative efforts.
