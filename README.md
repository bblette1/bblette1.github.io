# About

I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics and the Center for Causal Inference at the University of Pennsylvania. My main research interests are applications and methods development for causal inference, survival analysis, missing data, cluster-randomized trials, and health policy.

In July 2023, I will be joining the Biostatistics faculty at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
