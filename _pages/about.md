I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics and the Center for Causal Inference at the University of Pennsylvania. My main research interests are in methods development for causal inference, survival analysis, missing data, and cluster-randomized trials, with applications in areas such as infectious disease, pediatrics, critical care, and pulmonary medicine.

In July 2023, I will be joining the Biostatistics faculty at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
