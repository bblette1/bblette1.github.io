I'm currently a fourth year biostatistics Ph.D. student at UNC-Chapel Hill. My main research interests are in causal inference, survival analysis, and biomarker evaluation, with applications in infectious disease, in particular HIV/AIDS. Other research interests include health policy and disease surveillance.
