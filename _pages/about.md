I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Biostatistics Department at UNC-Chapel Hill. My main research interests are in causal inference, measurement error, survival analysis, and biomarker evaluation, with applications in infectious disease (HIV/AIDS in particular). Other research domains of interest include health policy and disease surveillance.

I'm currently on the job market. Feel free to contact me at blette 'at' unc.edu
