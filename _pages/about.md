I've recently joined the University of Pennsylvania as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics and the Center for Causal Inference. My main research interests are applications and methods development for causal inference, survival analysis, clinical trials, and health policy.

In Fall 2021, I defended my dissertation and graduated with a Ph.D. in Biostatistics from UNC - Chapel Hill.
