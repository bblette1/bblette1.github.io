I'm currently a fourth year Biostatistics Ph.D. student at UNC-Chapel Hill. My main research interests are in causal inference, survival analysis, and biomarker evaluation, with applications in infectious disease (HIV/AIDS in particular). Other research domains of interest include health policy and disease surveillance.
