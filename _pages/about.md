I'm an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics and the Center for Causal Inference at the University of Pennsylvania. I completed my doctoral studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My main research interests are applications and methods development for causal inference and clinical trials, with a particular focus on problems in infectious disease and critical care.
