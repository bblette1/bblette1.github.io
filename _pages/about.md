I'm currently a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics and the Center for Causal Inference at the University of Pennsylvania. My main research interests are applications and methods development for causal inference, survival analysis, missing data, cluster-randomized trials, and health policy.

In Fall 2021, I defended my dissertation and graduated with a Ph.D. in Biostatistics from UNC - Chapel Hill.
